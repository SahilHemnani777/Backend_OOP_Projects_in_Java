# Song_playlist_Working
--> A program that implements a playlist for songs
--> Composes of a Song class having Title and Duration for a song
--> The program will have an Album class containing a list of songs
--> The albums will be stored in an ArrayList 
--> Songs from different albums can be added to the playlist and will appear in the list in the order they are added
--> Once the songs have been added to the playlist, a menu of options will be displayed :- 
                                                                  Quit, 
                                                                  Skip forward to the next song, 
                                                                  Skip backwards to a previous song, 
                                                                  Replay the current song, 
                                                                  List the songs in the playlist, 
                                                                  Remove the song from playlist, 
--> A song must exist in an album before it can be added to the playlist (so you can only play songs that you own). As an optional extra.
